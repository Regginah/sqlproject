Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project where I applied SQL skills including CTEs, Temp Tables, Joins, Unions, Case Statements, and Window Functions to analyze company layoffs. 
A significant portion of the project focused on data cleaning, where I gained experience in removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, managing null and blank values, and selecting relevant columns. â˜†
